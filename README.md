# Plants vs. Zombies, Minecraft edition!
This is a spinoff of plants vs zombies where all of the characters are based off of minecraft mobs. Fight your way through zombies, spiders, skeletons, chicken jockeys, and endermen, and finally fight a secret final boss.

### How to play
Control the cursor with the arrow keys. Click on the emeralds falling from the sky to gain money. Once you have enough emeralds, buy a villager that will generate you more emeralds. Use emeralds to buy friendly minecraft mobs that will defend your village, such as dispensers shooting arrows, snow golems, and TNT. 

## Reflection
I think this was a very fun and educational project to make. I would like to try making PvZ in something like Python with Pygame, because I think it would be a really good lesson in object-oriented programming. One of the main challenges I had with this project is keeping track of all of the data of the different sprites. Because there is going to be multiple of every plant and zombie on the screen at some time, I had to use the sprite data extension and I had to iterate over an array of sprites a lot. This would be easier with Object-Oriented programming, and I had to do my best to recreate OOP in makecode with the blocks they have. I also learned how bad I am at pixel art, Matthias had to make almost all of the textures. You can tell which ones are made by him and which ones are made by me.
